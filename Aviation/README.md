# Aviation Analysis Projects

Self-development projects focused on data visualization & exploratory analysis using pandas, seaborn and matplotlib. Data used to create each chart is sourced from public sources (mostly Kaggle). Please refer to each ipython notebook for me details on each project:

- us-airlines-traffic-analysis │ Exploratory Analysis
- us-airlines-tweets-analysis │ Data Visualization
